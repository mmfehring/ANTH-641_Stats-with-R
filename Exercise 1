#DART POINTS!!
The best I can make of this thanks to Kevin's crash course, is that there is a huge variance between 75% and 100% in every measurement categoary. So many of these dart points are chonkers.
That's it, that's what I got.

#Different Data set
I chose Roman British Glass 2 (trace elements) (RBGlass2)
Apparently, R is case sensitive which is dumb. 
I pulled up the data for chromium and barium. Chromium is fairly low with a mean of 23.3 ppm but barium is hella high at 232 ppm.
A quick google search shows that barium increases luster in glass and we know the Romans like things shiny!

#Roman British Glass Concentrations
Best I got is that many of the samples are above the Calcium/Sodium line. I see how M and L relate to the localities. The red lines are the trace elements, and the box is standard deviations but why is it a box?
I could not say what this means, I understood more from the table. I like tables.
